        <dd>The Motherboard is a Printed Circuit Board that every other computer hardware component will be attached to in one way or another. It functions like a central hub that manages and connects all of your other parts.</dd>
        <dt><ins>CPU</ins></dt>
        <dd>CPU means Central Processing Unit and it processes any task that you might throw at it. Without it, the computer won<sup>,</sup>t work.<br>Almost everything you do on a computer will have to be calculated by the CPU in some way, so having a fast CPU (high frequency and high core count) will make your PC faster.</dd>
        <dt><ins>RAM</ins></dt>
        <DD>Random Access Memory (RAM) is the “short-term” memory part of the computer if you would compare it to a brain.<br>he RAM stores data that is actively being worked on by the CPU. RAM can read and write data extremely fast (much faster than any permanent storage solutions) but can't retain information once the power is turned off.</DD>
        <dt><ins>STORAGE DEVICE</ins></dt>
        <DD>Because RAM can't store anything without power and we do want to be able to turn off our computer from time to time, we need a storage medium that retains its stored data, even without electricity.</DD>
        <DT><INS>PSU</INS></DT>
        <DD>We went through many of the most important PC Components already, but your PC won’t work without a power supply to supply the PC with power.</DD>
        <DT><INS>GPU</INS></DT>
        <DD>Its purpose is the processing of anything that has to do with visuals and outputs these visuals (Images, User Interface, GUI, Video) onto the Monitor(s).</DD>
        <DT><INS>CASE</INS></DT>
        <DD>The Computer case is nothing more than a fancy-looking box that holds all of the PC’s components. It can be opened and closed and has pre-defined areas with screws and holes where all of the components are supposed to be placed and attached to.</DD>
        <DT><INS>COOLING</INS></DT>
        <DD>Anything that draws power also generates heat, and the CPU generates lots of heat.<BR>Anything that draws power also generates heat, and the CPU generates lots of heat.</DD>
        <DT><INS>MONITOR</INS></DT>
        <DD>Any PC that you want to interact with needs a display device such as a monitor, to be able to see what’s going on. Monitors come in all kinds of sizes, colors, resolutions, aspect ratios, and so on.</DD>
        <DT><INS>INPUT DEVICE</INS></DT>
        <DD>The devices which we plug into our sysytem , such as keyboard,mouse etc..</DD>
